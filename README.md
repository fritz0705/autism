autism python tools
===================

autism is a collection of WSGI middlewares, dict proxies for serialisation and
other useful modules.

* *autism.dict_proxy* Simple dictionary proxy objects, which perform tasks like
  serialisation or prefixing
* *autism.tools* Generic tools for parsing user or configuration input
* *autism.wsgi* Collection of WSGI middlewares
* *autism.compat* Py3k/Py2k compatibility code

This library was developed as part of a large web application based on Bottle,
and the web application failed, so this is open source.
